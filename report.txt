 A detailed report I could come up with listening to you speak! Hope I can be of any help :) 

Lets start with analysis of the tone with which you were speaking!

	1. Spot on with the deliberate long pauses between the different paragraphs.
	2. Oops, May be we hurried up a bit there. Felt like some sentences couldn't be distiguished from the other. If we could work upon those tiny little pauses to be able to differentiate sentences, may be the audience could connect better. You know what I am saying yeah?
	3. Aha! Bravo. Every question you put out there, piqued my curiosity to wanting to know the answer right away. Well done! Lets keep the tone rolling!
	4. Ooh! That was a high energy exciting talk.
	5. We could probably work on those soft pauses during a sentence.

Filler Words details: 
Your top 5 most used filler words are: 
	1. 'basically' used 2 times
	2. 'so' used 1 times

Okay we have another interesting insight that might help you. Looks like your speech contains 1.71% of filler words! Hope this helps you improve refining your talk :)

Did you just say that?! :O

Looks like I heard some words there that might well qualify to go behind a beep! Ooopppss!
Words that you might have uttered unconciosly that would probably need a little reconsideration, if appropriate to be used whilst talking to an audience as I could point out would be:
	1. 'shit' used 1 times
	2. 'damn' used 1 times
	3. 'fuck' used 1 times

I think it would be wonderful if we could reduce the usage of these words as if would create a sense of uncomforatability for certain people in the audience! It wont hurt to come clean every once in a while...Will it now?! :P
